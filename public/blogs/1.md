# How to Manage State in a React App

State management is a crucial aspect of building robust and scalable React applications. It determines how data flows through the app and how components interact with each other. In this guide, we'll explore different techniques to manage state effectively in a React app.

## **What is State?**

State is a JavaScript object that holds dynamic data and determines the behavior of a component. It allows components to respond to user input, network responses, and other events.

## **Types of State in React**

1. **Local State**  
   Managed within a single component using `useState` or `useReducer`.
   - Example: Form inputs, toggles, modals.

2. **Global State**  
   Shared across multiple components in the application.
   - Example: Authentication status, user preferences.

3. **Server State**  
   Data fetched from a server and integrated into the application.
   - Example: API responses, caching strategies.

4. **URL State**  
   Data stored in the URL such as query parameters and route paths.
   - Example: Filters, pagination.

## **State Management Techniques**

### **1. useState Hook**
The `useState` hook is the simplest way to manage local state in a functional component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
